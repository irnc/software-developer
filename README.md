_See [I (initial point in this web)](https://github.com/irnc/i)._

_I develop software for living_. This exact phrase accounts for [626 search results according to Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22I%20develop%20software%20for%20living%22).

I am saying it too, because I do develop software for living.

I used to be a PHP developer. Then a PhoneGap developer, and now JavaScript and Web are my daily job.

Source code should be reabalbe, so we strive to creat [clean code](https://github.com/irnc/clean-code).

## What to do?

Why am I doing softare development? It ain't for money. Working full days, for 40 years ahead will not bring me even $2 million. It is not about total value, it is about how much my contributions are valued. It is about for how much I can ask in response.

I am dissatisfied with what can be achived keeping existing state of affairs. There are a lot of issues which are completely wrong. For many reasons it is not alright to maintain status quo. It should be changed.

Is it possible be change everything by yourself? Not for me. But I still want to change a lot of things. Here comes money, required to ask people to act the way it is needed for me. Money is a reality check to see that a change is needed.

I am a software developer, it is a well paid job, but how much time it takes in exchange? How much time should I allow to take it from my life? Ideally none, as this will not bring me closer to my goal, it will not give me enough money for sustainable change.

Being optimistic means seeing task in every issue, combine it with being a software developer, and there is a _missing automation_ in every issue.

So, I am developing software to explore _everything new to me_ and to understand it on the way of conducting a paid job. Why it is needed? To learn someting new every day, ... (it is late, list will be expanded).

There is a need for a drastical change, and I need to keep exploring to find a way, how I can make sustainable change to myself and to the World surrounding me.

### Should I share my findings?

You never know what you will found when exploring _in the wild_. It may be valuable knowleage, new opportunity, or things which better left private. Knowleadge is worth sharing it for sure. New opportunities should be explored deeper in order to be exploitable, though it depends which part should be shared, so I can use this opportunity towards my goals.

Other than that, there are personal issues. Looking for something may reveal details which should be kept private. Either for ethical norms, personal security concerns or because of gray zones in understanding legal consequences.

## Beginners; is it worth to become a software engineer?

Some has said that [_software engineers will be obsolete by 2060_](https://medium.com/@dtauerbach/software-engineers-will-be-obsolete-by-2060-2a214fdf9737). It is 2015, and it is hard to belive in that statement; given arguments are weak and laughable, consider following one, which is _major_:

> The current version of the profession is under pressure along two fronts. First, there are website-building tools like Weebly that allow anyone to build a website without writing software.
