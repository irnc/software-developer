_See [I (initial point in this web)](https://github.com/irnc/i)._

_I develop software for living_. This exact phrase accounts for [626 search results according to Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22I%20develop%20software%20for%20living%22).

I am saying it too, because I do develop software for living.

I used to be a PHP developer. Then a PhoneGap developer, and now JavaScript and Web are my daily job.
